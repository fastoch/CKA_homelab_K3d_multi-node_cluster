# Introduction

The goal of this tutorial is to set up a homelab for preparing the **CKA exam**.  

## K3s 

K3s is a **lightweight**, easy-to-install, deploy, and manage **version** of stock **Kubernetes** (K8s).  
No, it is not a fork of Kubernetes, K3s is a certified Kubernetes distribution.

# K3d & kubectl

K3d is a tool for running K3s single- and multi-node clusters in **Docker**.  
Coupling it with **kubectl** makes a perfect homelab for preparing the CKA exam.  

This combo supports context switching between clusters to mimic exam scenarios.
